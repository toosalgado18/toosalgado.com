### Vhost Creation
```
Good afternoon,

As requested, your new domain has been created. The information you will need to access and use your new domain is posted below:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Website Information
---------------------------------------------------------------
Domain: example.com
DocumentRoot: /var/www/vhosts/example.com
SFTP IP: 123.123.123.123
SFTP Username: example

### Directory Deletion
```
Hello team,

You have requested we delete upwork2019's home folder on the following servers: 1018731 php7.regattanetwork.com

Please be aware that:

- This action is permanent.
- Rackspace does not perform data recovery or forensics.
- Our backup service adds a measure of data protection, but restores take time, and may also fail completely.
- In the event that this action results in unintended data loss, loss of functionality and/or downtime, Rackspace is indemnified upon your understanding and agreement with all of these risks.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Please update this ticket with the phrase “I am aware” indicating you are aware of the risks.
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you are not comfortable with moving forward with the requested operation, please contact your Account Manager/Service Delivery Manager or Business Development Consultant for alternate options.
```

### MI Customer
```
Hi team,

Thank you for your update

As this account is on the Managed Infrastructure service level, the OS or development level issues become the responsibility of you and your team, leaving the hardware and network management to Rackspace. However, we will try our best to guide you and provide options.

Here are how-to guides and articles related to:

We have the following options which would allow Rackspace to help troubleshoot - billable services or upgrading your service level. Please see below for further explanation:

Upgrading to Managed Operations. With this service level our administrators can log into your server to help troubleshoot and take care of most tasks for you. For further information please review https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/adding-a-managed-operations-service-level-to-your-cloud-account/

Billable Services allows our admins to make their best effort going above and beyond your normal Service Level Agreement for a fee. Here is a link to learn more about these services: https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/os-billable-services-for-managed-infrastructure-customers/

I will mark this ticket as pending your update. Once we receive your reply we will be able to proceed accordingly.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.
```

### No Swap space for cloud infrastructure
```
Hi team,

Thank you for contacting us.

This is the expected result of a General Purpose server as by default, swap partitions are not created on our public Cloud servers so as not to impact the performance of other servers on the host. This is mentioned in the following articles:

https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/compute/cloud-servers-product-concepts/create-server/#swap
https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/swap-space-on-cloud-servers/

As noted, Rackspace recommends choosing a server flavor with enough RAM to support your application without the use of swap.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.
```

### System Disk for bootup
```
Hi team,

Thank you for reaching out. As the volume's mount status will impact whether or not it can be successfully detached, I would advise the following to resolve the issue:

Since this is a System Disk and is attached at /dev/xvda, you will need to make sure the server is Shutoff, then detach the volume. You will need to use the API to detach the System Disk:

https://pitchfork.rax.io/servers/#unattach_volume_from_server-cloud_servers

The following is outlined in this document as well, specifically the Deatch a Volume section:https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/increase-size-of-cloud-boot-from-volume-server-system-disk/

Once it is detached, you can simply re-attach it at the /dev/xvda position in the Cloud Control Panel and issue a reboot to power the server on.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can reach out to us by updating this ticket or by calling support and referencing this ticket.

### Cloud Incident Notification

#### First Prefab
```
Hello team,

Thank you for contacting Rackspace Support today.

We apologize, this occurred due to the hypervisor on which your server resides has experienced a hardware failure. Our Data center Operations team is working to replace the affected component.

We do have a three strike process in place where if a host has three incidents like this within 60 days then our operations team will migrate all the servers on that host to a different host.

If you'd like to request a host migration before then, please let us know and we can perform that, but please note there could be some downtime involved as part of the migration process.

You can also migrate your server at any time through the Cloud Control Panel

Rackspace Cloud >> Servers >> Cloud Servers >> Server Name >> Actions >> Migrate Server

We again apologize for this inconvenience. Rackspace constantly monitors our services and related components to prevent downtime. We take proactive steps to minimize issues, and work to resolve them quickly when they occur.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.
```

#### Second Prefab
```
The hypervisor was rebooted after becoming unresponsive. Due to the highly flexible and volatile nature of our public cloud, we do not do RCA's for hypervisor incidents. We encourage customers to architect their environment in such a way where they do not depend on a single server, so in that regard, the potential for hardware failure should be factored into their cloud architecture.

That being said, we do have a 3 strike system and will decommission hosts that have experienced multiple issues.
Please let us know if you have any questions.
```

### Linux OOM
```
Hi team,

As this account is on the Managed Infrastructure service level, the OS or development level issues become the responsibility of you and your team, leaving the hardware and network management to Rackspace. However, we will try our best to guide you and provide options.

Linux has an out-of-memory (OOM) killer that can close processes when memory gets low to preserve enough memory for the OS. When I went to check on the emergency console, I realized there were OOM messages for Apache, this may be the root cause of the issue. You can read more about it in the following links:

Linux Out-of-Memory Killer
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/it-infrastructure/dev-oom-killer.html
https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/linux-out-of-memory-killer/

I am currently unable to see memory and CPU usage for this server in the Cloud Control Panel as the Rackspace Monitoring Agent is not installed. By installing the Rackspace Monitoring Agent, you can document the server's health status to find periods of excessive usage.

Install and configure the Rackspace Monitoring Agent
https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/install-and-configure-the-rackspace-monitoring-agent/

Here are also some steps you can take to investigate your server's system load:

Check the System Load on Linux

### DNS API Calls
```
Hello team,

I was not able to find a curl command for DNS records but I did find some other commmands:

Check DNS Records in the Linux Terminal
https://www.2daygeek.com/check-find-dns-records-of-domain-in-linux-terminal/

You are also able to export and send other Cloud DNS commands through the API tool Pitchfork:

DNS - API Calls

```

### Not SSL in a website
```
Hi team,

Thank you for your update.

From our side, we do not store or manage the SSL certificate on your server as we do not have access to login to your server. I've also checked on the account and as you do not have any Load Balancers on the account, this would indicate the SSL is managed at the server level.

In attempting to loadhttps://www.jrcompany.comI see that this domain is not able to provide a secure connection which would indicate the server does not know how to respond to an https request. This could indicate that the virtual host for the domain is not configured for HTTPS or the SSL Engine is not enabled to handle the secure traffic.

I would advise reaching out to your developers to look into the SSL configuration on the server.

As we do not log into customer's servers with your service level, we are only able to provide guidance. We have the following options which would allow Rackspace to help troubleshoot - billable services or upgrading your service level. Please see below for further explanation:

Upgrading to Managed Operations. With this service level our administrators can log into your server to help troubleshoot and take care of most tasks for you. For further information please reviewhttps://support.rackspace.com/how-to/adding-a-managed-operations-service-level-to-your-cloud-account/

Billable Services allows our admins to make their best effort going above and beyond your normal Service Level Agreement for a fee. Here is a link to learn more about these services:https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/os-billable-services-for-managed-infrastructure-customers/

I will now mark this ticket for closure. Please feel free to update this ticket should you require any further information or assistance

### Malware Removal for MI Customers.
```
Hi team,

Thank you for contacting us.

We are not able to assist with the removal of malware on a server. This would be something your team would need to handle or you would need to reach out to a security firm to assess and remove the malware on your server. Furthermore, as you are utilizing our Infrastructure service level, our teams do not have access to your environment to review or make changes on your behalf.

Due to the complexity of malware and how it infects a system, we are not equipped to provide guidance or documentation on removal of malware on a server as each infection will produce different results and infect the server using different methods.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.

### Servermill No Root Access
```
Hello team,

Automation could not complete on this server because it was not able to log in to the server.

------------------------------

------------------------------

There are no Rackspace managed users/passwords configured on this server so we are not able to log in to the device.

If you would like automation to complete on this server we will need to be able to log in to the device, adjust the configuration if necessary, and have a valid root password to allow root to log in to complete the automation tasks. Any configuration and the root password can be reverted/changed after automation completes.

Without the completion of automation the backup agent is not installed. If you do not require backups on this server then that may be okay for your purposes. I noted that the Zolo.ca - Stage server does have backups configured.

Are you able to log in to the device?
Is everything working as expected?
Do you require backups on this server?
Optionally, if you are able to log in to the server, you could configure backups manually. The easiest way to install the cloud backup agent is to click the "install the Cloud Backup agent" link at bottom of the server details page and follow the instructions. Alternately you could follow the instructions at the following link:

https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-install-the-agent-on-linux

Please let us know how you would like to proceed. Please let us know if no further work is required from Rackspace and we can mark this server as "online/complete".

If you have any questions or we can be of any assistance please update this ticket or call 1-888-480-7640 any time 24/7..

### Cloud Server Software Firewall Updates Failed

#### First Prefab
```
Hello Team,

We have received an alert regarding Cloud Server Software Firewall Updates failing.

Please see a summary of my investigation below:

The software firewall updates for the "p0012.mmghost.net" server (862cf7f5-e7c6-4df5-9b42-712fadef8184) are failing due to the server requiring SSH key authentication:
No suitable authentication method found to complete authentication

Please note that we require some additional information in order to move forward with this ticket.

The details we require are as follows:

As your cloud account is at the Managed Infrastructure service level, we are unable to log into the device to troubleshoot or diagnose issues.

We will require password authentication to temporarily be allowed in order for the automation to run and finish the software firewall updates.  Once password authentication is enabled, we will be able to re-run the automation and get the updates down.  We will require the 'rackconnect' user to be able to connect using the following password:

Ni3+r5!F8Qs/

Can you also confirm if the server is using the default port 22 for SSH and if the SSH process has been reloaded since changing the SSH settings.

Once you've verified the password for the rackconnect user is set, I would advise modifying your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to have a Match User statement to allow password authentication for the rackconnect user as this would only be used by our automation.

Example:

Match User rackconnect
     PasswordAuthentication yes

Once we receive your reply that this has been completed, we will be able to proceed with re-running automation to allow the updates to go through.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.
```
#### Second Prefab
```
Hello Team,

This update is to inform you of an issue that occurred when we attempted to run automatic updates for your Rackconnect setup.

An error occurred due to the connection timing out when our automation attempted to connect to the following server:

Account:
Server:
UUID:
Region:

This automation keeps your server updates with the necessary firewall updates to maintain your Rackconnect setup (ie, cloud server linked to your dedicated firewall).

Since the aforementioned account is Managed Infrastructure, we are unable to log into the server to make the necessary changes that would allow Rackconnect automation to complete successfully.

Here are the conditions that automation needs in order to complete successfully:
- The root user is allowed to SSH.
- Password authentication is allowed in SSH.
- SSH is listening on TCP port 22.
- SSH is listening on both the initial public IP and the Private IP.
- The root password has not changed between the Cloud Server's creation and when automation logs in.
- Proper OpenSSL packages installed on server so wget can negotiate a connection with externalservices.rackconnect.rackspace.com
- We will require the 'rackconnect' user to be able to connect using the following password:
    PASSWORD
- Once you've verified the password for the rackconnect user is set, I would advise modifying your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to have a Match User statement to allow password authentication for the rackconnect user as this would only be used by our automation.

Match User rackconnect
PasswordAuthentication yes

Once these settings are either changed or verified, we can attempt to run automation again.

I will mark this ticket as pending your update. Once we receive your reply we will be able to proceed accordingly.
```

### GRUB UEFI Update Failure
```
In another ticket placed with our Managed Operations team where our Linux Admins could log into the VM and issue commands themselves, they encountered this error and appear to have resolved it with the following:

mount /dev/xvda15 /boot/efi/
apt-get install grub-efi
apt-get purge grub*
apt-get install grub-efi
tail -1 /etc/mtab
tail -1 /etc/mtab >> /etc/fstab

NOTE: Before you attempt these same changes, I would advise that you take an image of your server in it's present state so that should anything go wrong with the changes, you can revert back to the state prior to those changes.
```

### OS Upgrade for Cloud
```
Hi Team,

Thank you for contacting us.

That is correct, the only method available to move to a new OS would be to spin up new servers with the desired OS and migrate your data.

Our teams can help with creating a server and setting it up for you, but your team will need to handle the data migration as we do not support this process.

Alternatively, Rackspace Technology can also manage migrations on your behalf with our Professional Services team. If you would like a free Statement of Work (SOW), please let us know and we can connect you with your account team for next steps.

I will tentatively mark this ticket for closure while you confer with your team regarding this process.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling support.
```

### Live Migrations

#### First Prefab
```
Hello team,

Cloud Server 'SERVER' was part of an infrastructure related live migration. Live-migrations are a continuous part of our operational workflow. They enable us to do security and lifecycle patching for hypervisors without customer impact-at least that is the hope. However, in some of the case of the cases, or with older operating systems, live-migration may cause an impact. We do apologize for the inconvenience.

In rare cases, outdated kernels provided by outdated OS's can clash with the virtualization driver responsible for communicating with the "host" (the hypervisor) of the Cloud Server. This has to do with the releasing of disk locks and transferring data of a live system.

In cases where the live migration process causes service disruption, we can add metadata to the servers to opt them out of any future scheduled live migrations where we will instead schedule reboot migrations for the servers any time that they need to be moved to another host. Please let us know if you would like us to add this metadata to the server.

The following are just some links I recommend perusing when or if convenient regarding relying on a monolithic system.

https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-ops/bestpractice/
https://www.rackspace.com/en-au/blog/accommodating-the-whole-barnyard

We thank you for being a customer, and if you have any questions, please create a ticket or give us a call at any time, we are happy to help.
```

#### Second Prefab
```
I can see the server 'gridiron-4' was recently live migrated to a new host within the datacentre. Sometimes we do need to live migrate servers to a different host to perform maintenance on the previous one.

To do this we perform a live migration which is usually a seamless process and isn't expected to cause any downtime. However in this case it seems the live migration caused your server to crash.

I can confirm the migration started on the TIME UTC and completed successfully at TIME UTC

These are the support options available to customers who are running on an EOL OS:

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟏: Extended Support Option - Not available for Public Cloud customers

If you are planning to remain on your EOL device(s) and
would like to be able to submit support requests without being billed per
request, you may opt into an Extended Support Option. This option is advised
for customers that are still working to get to a supported Linux OS, however
they still require support to perform work that falls within our Spheres of
Support. Please understand that some requests may not be possible to complete
due to the OS being EOL. This option carries an additional charge per month of
$50 USD per device.

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟐: Migration Server (Advised)

Rackspace Support team will set up a physical or virtual
migration server, with a new, supported OS for you to perform your migration.
This option may be necessary for customers utilizing legacy hardware that is
marked as an End of Life platform by the hardware vendor or that are no longer
certified for use by the OS vendor. Please reach out to your Customer Success
Manager for information and pricing on migration server options.

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟑: Reinstall a new, supported OS on current
hardware with new hard drives

Rackspace Support team will perform a fresh install of a
supported operating system on your server (legacy hardware is Migration option 3 only)
with a new hard drive. The drives currently containing your data may be
reattached after the install process (subject to hardware limitations), to
allow you access to your pre-reinstall data and configuration files. A backup
of your server prior to reinstall is recommended and can be used to restore
data onto the new system (total storage space permitting).

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟒: Professional Services

If you are unable to or would like to have someone else to
perform the migration required in Option 3, Rackspace will work with you and
one of our partners to assist. Please reach out to your Customer Success
Manager for information and pricing.

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟓: RedHat Extended Lifecycle Patching (Only
for RHEL systems, not CentOS)

Frequently paired with Option 2 - Extended Support, this option is recommended if you are planning to remain on your RHEL 6.x device(s) in the short term. This service is required to continue to receive any patches from Red Hat that they have deemed critical impact security fixes and select urgent priority bug fixes, but this is for a LIMITED and SMALL subset of core OS packages, for an Operating System that is ALREADY End of Life. We must stress that it will not continue to patch the entire OS and there is no guarantee of updates. To take advantage of this option, the system must be updated to Redhat 6.10.

Please either respond to this ticket or reach out to your Customer Success Manager as soon as possible and let us know which option best fits your needs.
```

### Migration Plan

In order to migrate to a new server, here is the plan we usually follow:

1.  You advise what type of server and OS version you want to migrate to, and spin up a new server accordingly. You will get the pricing info, on the page of creating new server after selecting the resources you needed on new server.
2.  We handle installation and configuration of supported services and packages, and verify that your settings on the new device (vhosts, PHP tunables, etc.) are reasonably mirrored to your old system. Please keep in mind that there are often changes in default settings between major versions (such as when changing from PHP 5 to PHP 7), and we may not be able to guarantee that everything is *exactly* the same as it was before.
3.  Your team owns migration of any data to the new server. This includes databases and web files. In some cases, we may run commands to this end as a reasonable endeavor, but you must verify the integrity of that data and ensure it is in the right place. Additionally, not all technicians are comfortable moving customer data around, so this is handled entirely on a case-by-case basis.
4.  Your team continues to test and verify the stability of the new environment, while we provide our normal support for the new device. Once you are confident that the new environment is ready to go live, we'll move any DNS that needs to be changed over to the new server.
5.  Take an image of the old device and shut it down, and verify that nothing else on that server is needed.
6.  Delete the old server.

### SFTP or FTP
```
We can absolutely help with you with this jailed user. We do have to ask some clarification about which protocol you are wanting to use. Customers sometimes use FTP and SFTP interchangeably because they do serve the same function, but they are two different protocols.

FTP - Typically uses Port 21, and information is transferred in plain text (including passwords).
SFTP - Utilizes the same Secure Shell that SSH utilizes over Port 22 (or a custom port if you have SSH setup on a custom port), and information transferred with binary encryption.

We, of course, recommend that customers use SFTP over FTP, but we do understand that some customers use third-party programs or applications that require FTP.

Which protocol would you like this user created for: FTP or SFTP?

### Spamhaus PBL
```
Hi team,

This is to make you aware that we are continuing to review this ticket.

Due to the dynamic way IP addresses are assigned and removed on cloud servers they are often found on lists such as the SPAMHAUS PBL. This is something which is common with public clouds and is not specific to Rackspace cloud.

As stated by Spamhaus all IP addresses which are not designated mail server machines should be on the PBL list.

Cloud servers by default are not designated mail servers so it should be expected to find cloud servers public IP's on this list.

Please be aware sending mail on cloud servers is not something Rackspace recommends as there can be no guarantee of email delivery. For best results we recommend using an email relay service such as MailGun, SendGrid, Mail Chimp, and/or others.

There is more information about Mailgun below:
https://www.mailgun.com/rackspace/

Blacklists are also controlled by third parties which Rackspace does not have any control over so we are therefore not able to remove IP's on your behalf.

According to Spamhaus this list should not prevent you sending emails from your server. I have found the following guide in our how-to centre which has further information on sending mail from a cloud server:
https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/preparing-the-cloud-server-to-be-a-mail-server/

As mentioned previously, we DO NOT recommend sending email from our OpenStack Public Cloud (OPC) assigned range of IPs. If you wish to still use the Cloud Server there are two ways to go around having external sources block email from your IP.

1.  Use an Email Relay service like Mailgun, Mail Chimp, and/or others.
2.  Obtain your own Dedicated Block of Public IPS for all your cloud servers by utilizing RackConnect Hybrid Cloud.

A third and fourth option, although they do not involve using a Cloud Server as an email server, it to use our:
3\. RackSpace Managed Hosted Email services which does not using OpenStack Public Cloud (OPC) IP block ranges.
or
4\. Dedicated Physical server which gets you get a Dedicated Block of IPs assigned by your Physical Firewall appliance/s.

Please feel free to reach out to your Technical Customer Service Manager, for further guidance and/or to coordinate further technical discussions.

If you require any further information or assistance, you can contact us by updating this ticket or by calling us.

### Cloud Backup Errors - could not translate
```
Hello,

The backup completed but it did experience errors with the following files:

/var/tmp/systemd-private-dd96b55752cc4e039dc907cade09757a-fwupd.service-7TNPph

/var/tmp/systemd-private-dd96b55752cc4e039dc907cade09757a-fwupd.service-7TNPph/tmp

We do see this from time to time. It generally occurs when a backup process starts and indexes all files it needs to backup. It then goes through and backs up said files. If the file changes or disappears after the initial indexing you can get errors such as this.

As /var/tmp is a temp directory we do not recommend backing it up as generally you never need to backup temporary data and it will cause errors. The fix would just be to exclude this directory from the backup or ignore them. I'd also recommend reading our backup best practices:

https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/best-practices-for-cloud-backup
```

### Segmentation Fault Driveclient
```
We currently don't have a full understanding of the issue but we do have a internal bug report open and our developers are currently looking at this issue.

It seems the glibc getpwuid() function used by the Agent/Updater is failing due to an issue with nsswitch and sssd running in lieu of nscd. While not the greatest workaround, this can be fixed by installing nscd, and disabling sssd. This can be done with the following commands:

yum -y install nscd &&
systemctl enable nscd &&
systemctl start nscd &&
systemctl disable sssd &&
systemctl stop sssd

After that, go ahead and restart the cloudbackup-updater and driveclient services and go ahead and give the registration a try once more to see if it continues to segfault.

### MBU Backup Installation Prefab
```
Hello Team,

We have completed configuration of Managed Backup for this server. Please see your current Managed Backup Configuration below for details pertaining to the Backup save set, Backup Exclusions, Data retention, and Schedules. Please take a special note at the end of the configuration details pertaining to backing up a large amount of data with Managed Backup.

## ================================================================================
1238007-1222132-prod-arbatchjms7.bectran.com - 166.78.193.145
Job Encryption: Enabled (AES-256)

Linux File System (defaultBackupSet)
Subclient: default
Schedule(s): Full Backup Weekly On Friday at 03:00 (America/Chicago).
Incremental Backups at 03:00 (America/Chicago) the rest of the
week.

# Standard Exclusions active

This Schedule can be changed, if this time is not satisfactory considering your server's configuration. Available time slots to choose from are listed below:
00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 18:00, and 21:00.

By agreeing to the terms set forth herein and as part of the managed backup service, you are opting to receive backup failure automation (the " Out of Schedule Backup Permitted feature"). The Out of Schedule Backup Permitted feature will initiate an immediate backup after a failure.

If you wish to opt-out of the Out of Schedule Backup Permitted feature, please respond to this ticket. If, at any time, you experience server load issues as a result of the Out of Schedule Backup Permitted feature initiating a backup out of schedule, Rackspace can opt you out of this feature, at a later date.

Be advised that opting out of the Out of Schedule Backup Permitted feature may result in an extended period of time without data protection for your file system or application, and Rackspace hereby disclaims any liability for such delay.

Note that the Managed Backup Service, upon being initially configured, backs up *ALL* data by default, including that of any additional, attached storage devices like DAS or SAN. Excluding non-essential data or file paths from your backups ensures that your server’s backups run and complete efficiently and in optimal time. Please update this ticket or contact your support team to let us know if any directories or paths may be excluded from being backed up.

Managed backup configuration and activity are available in the portal at https://my.rackspace.com \> Services > Managed Backup. Listings there are updated several times daily. When requesting a restore, you can do so from the portal as well. In the portal under >Services> Managed Backup locate the link "Request Restore" and follow the guided instructions.

\*\*PLEASE BE ADVISED: Open, locked or live files cannot be backed up as they are in use by the operating system or application. This includes Linux/Unix database files such as /var/lib/mysql/\*.

Our internal Backup Restore Policy is as follows: for on-site tape storage, we will begin processing your request within two hours of receipt, and within six hours of receipt for off-site tape storage. By default we do not overwrite any data, all data is restored to an alternate location on your server.

We would like to emphasize that Rackspace Managed Backup is not a Bare Metal Disaster Recovery Service; it is a Data Protection service. Nevertheless, when necessary, we will make every effort to recover a full system restore.

Please be aware that the Unmetered Managed Backup Service does not imply that the volume of data that can be backed up is unlimited- it simply means that you are not billed against how much data you back up each month. While the Unmetered Managed Backup Service is well suited to reliably protecting data, we have observed challenges with some servers backing up, and, subsequently restoring, large volumes of data.

If you intend on hosting a large volume of data on this server please be aware of these inherent limitations and we encourage you to watch your server(s) backup usage and details any time in the MyRackspace Portal at https://my.rackspace.com \> Services > Managed Backup.

If the data set you are backing up exceeds that which can be effectively backed up within 24 hours or in an acceptable time, please contact your support team and they can assist with finding the right data protection to suit your requirements.

If you have any questions, or if we can be of any help, please do not hesitate to contact us.
